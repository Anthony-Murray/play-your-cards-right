# Higher Lower Card Game

Higher or Lower is a classic card game where players must guess whether the next card in the deck will be higher or lower than the current card. 

This version is based on the classic [Play Your Cards Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_Your_Cards_Right) game show broadcast on ITV from 1 February 1980 to 22 November 1987, produced by LWT, and hosted by Bruce Forsyth.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the site was kept very simple, using only two colours. The green background was chosen as it's a classic colour for playing card tables and white was used for the buttons and text. As colour will be introduced with the playing cards it is important to keep the game container as minimalist as possible.
